To develop and deploy NFT smart contracts ,
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  1. Choose a blockchain platform: You need to choose a blockchain platform that supports NFTs such as Ethereum or Binance Smart Chain.

  2. Write the Smart Contract code: You can use a programming language like Solidity to write the smart contract code. 
  
  we have defined a smart contract named MyNFT that extends ERC721 (the standard for NFTs) and ReentrancyGuard (a security feature to prevent reentrant calls).

  We have defined several variables such as owner (the address that deploys the contract), maxNftCount (the maximum number of NFTs that can be minted), nftMintedCount    (the number of NFTs that have already been minted), mintingStartTime and mintingEndTime (the duration when NFTs can be minted).

  We have also defined a mapping named _hasMinted to keep track of whether a wallet has already minted an NFT or not.

  The mintNFT function is the function that allows users to mint NFTs. It checks whether minting is allowed at the current time, whether the wallet has already minted an   NFT or not, and whether all NFTs have been minted or not. If all conditions are satisfied, the function mints an NFT and sets its metadata.

  3 Compile the Smart Contract code: Once you have written the smart contract code, you need to compile it using a Solidity compiler such as Remix or Truffle.

  4. Deploy the Smart Contract: After compiling.
  
  NFT Web Application :-
  --------------------
  To create a web application that interacts with the smart contract and allows users to claim (mint) NFTs to their connected wallet, you can follow these steps:

  1. Choose a React framework: You can choose any preferred React framework such as Next.js or Gatsby.js.

  2 Set up the React app: You can use Bootstrap to style the React app and set up the basic layout.

  3. Install web3.js or ether.js: You need to install web3.js or ether.js to interact with the smart contract from the web app. You can use npm or yarn to install the   library.

  4. Connect to the Ethereum network: You need to connect to the Ethereum network using a provider such as MetaMask or Infura. You can use web3.js or ether.js to connect to the network.

  5. Load the smart contract: You need to load the smart contract into the web app using web3.js or ether.js. You can do this by passing the contract address and ABI (Application Binary Interface) to the library.

  6. Display the NFT metadata: After minting an NFT, the web app should display the NFT image from the metadata. You can do this by calling the tokenURI function of the smart contract and displaying the image using an <img> tag.
  
  7. Handle errors: You need to handle errors that may occur during the interaction with the smart contract. For example, if the user tries to mint an NFT outside the allowed duration or has already minted the maximum number of NFTs, an error message should be displayed.
  
  8. how to interact with the smart contract using web3.js:
  
  
  import Web3 from 'web3';
  
  import { abi } from './MyNFT.json';
  
  const contractAddress = '0x123...'; // Replace with contract address
  
  async function mintNFT() {
  
    const web3 = new Web3(window.ethereum);
    
    await window.ethereum.enable(); // Request permission to connect to the Ethereum network
    
    const contract = new web3.eth.Contract(abi, contractAddress);
    
    const accounts = await web3.eth.getAccounts();
    
    const account = accounts[0];
    
    try {
    
      await contract.methods.mintNFT('https://example.com/nft-metadata.json').send({ from: account });
      
      const tokenId = await contract.methods.tokenOfOwnerByIndex(account, 0).call();
      
      const tokenURI = await contract.methods.tokenURI(tokenId).call();
      
      // Display the NFT image from the metadata using tokenURI
      
      console.log(tokenURI);
      
    } catch (error) {
    
      // Handle error
      
      console.error(error);
      
    }
    
  }
  

In the above code, we have imported the abi (Application Binary Interface) of the smart contract and defined the contract address. We have also defined a function named mintNFT that uses web3.js to connect to the Ethereum network, load the smart contract, and mint an NFT by calling the mintNFT function of the smart contract. After minting the NFT, we get the token ID and token URI from the smart contract using the tokenOfOwnerByIndex and tokenURI functions respectively. Finally, we display the NFT image from the metadata using the token URI. We also handle errors that may occur during the interaction with the smart contract.
